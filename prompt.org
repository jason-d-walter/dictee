#+title: Prompt

* Details

I want to build a simple, colorful iPad web app for my Grade 2 daughter to practice her French Immersion 'Dictée' (spelling) words.

* Core Functionality:

Admin Input: A simple password-protected or hidden view where I can input a list of French words for the week.

The Practice Loop: The app should display a word, play its audio using the Web Speech API (set to a French voice), and then hide the word so she can type it out.

Accent Support: Since she is 7, she needs a dedicated row of 'Quick Buttons' for French characters like é, à, ç, ê, and ë so she doesn't have to hunt for them on the system keyboard.

Gamification: Every correct word earns a 'Star.' When she finishes the list, show a confetti animation and a summary of her score.

Persistence: Use a simple backend (like Supabase or local storage for now) to track which words she has mastered vs. which ones she needs to practice more.

* Game Modes

There should be 3 modes:

Mode A: "L'Audio-Match" (Recognition)
The app plays the French audio for a word. Three floating bubbles appear with different French words. She taps the one that matches the sound.

Why: Builds the connection between French phonics and visual spelling.

Mode B: "Lettres Perdues" (Scaffolded Spelling)
The word is displayed with 1–2 missing letters (e.g., if the word is maison, show m_is_n). She drags the missing letters into the slots.

Why: Focuses on common French letter combinations (like "on," "ou," "ch").

Mode C: "La Dictée Fantôme" (The Main Event)
The app plays the audio. A blank text box and a colorful keyboard appear. She must type the word from scratch.

Why: This directly mimics her Friday test.

* Design Aesthetic:

Large, kid-friendly buttons.

High-contrast text.

Clean, rounded UI (use Tailwind CSS).

Mobile-first/iPad responsive layout.

Technical Constraints:

Use React with Tailwind CSS.

Use the 'canvas-confetti' library for celebrations.

Ensure the 'Speak' button uses the window.speechSynthesis API with the 'fr-FR' locale.

Please start by building a development plan to execute the above functionality.
